# Travel journal React(VIte) 
My first React project, powered on Vite, fully by myself. 
This is a solution to a solo project I was given to do on Scrimba. Scrimba is a widely used platform to lear or sharpen coding skills.

## Requirements
* Use .map() and props
* Styled cleeanly
* Responsive for every device
* Create an array of data objects in a separate .js file
